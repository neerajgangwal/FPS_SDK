# FPS_SDK
It is an Optical Finger Print Scanner SDK. I've Developed this SDK for NITGEN Biometric Finger Print but it supports most of the optical finger print scanners.
You need to import two important jar files. 
1). NBioBSPJNI.jar
2). swing-layout.jar
You also need to copy supporting libraries in java library path.
